# Litheskateboards Woocommerce customizations
A custom plugin to add some JS, CSS and PHP functions for Woocommerce customizations. Main goals are: 1. have product options displayed as buttons in single product page, 2. have the last option show up only after selecting all previous ones, 3. jump directly to cart (checkout?) after selecting the last option. No settings page needed at this moment (but could be added later if needed).
